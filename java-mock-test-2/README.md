# Java Theory Notes

## 1. What is bytecode?
Bytecode is the **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler (.class file) that is platform-independent and executed by the JVM.

## 2. Difference between C and Java
| Feature | C | Java |
|---------|---|------|
| Compilation | Directly compiled to machine code | Compiled to bytecode, runs on JVM |
| Platform | Platform-dependent | Platform-independent |
| OOP | Not fully OOP | Fully OOP |
| Security | Less secure | More secure |
| Memory Management | Manual (malloc/free) | Automatic (Garbage Collection) |
| Pointer | Contains pointer | Does not contain pointer |

## 3. What is keywords?
Keywords are **reserved words** in Java that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., `class`, `public`, `static`).

## 4. What is variables? How to create a variable?
A variable is a **container** which is used to store some value or data. The type and size of value will be decided by the datatype.
A datatype will be used while creating a variable.

```java
int age = 25;
```

## 5. What is datatype? List all the datatypes.
Datatypes define the type of data a variable can store.
- **Primitive:** byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
- **Non-primitive:** String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces

## 6. What is identifier? Rules for creating an identifier.
Identifier = Name for variable, method, class.
Rules:
1. Must start with letter, `_`, or `$`
2. Cannot start with a digit
3. No spaces or special symbols (except `_`, `$`)
4. Cannot be a keyword

## 7. What is operator? List all the operators.
Operators perform operations on data.
- Arithmetic: `+ - * / %`
- Relational: `== != > < >= <=`
- Logical: `&& || !`
- Assignment: `= += -= *= /= %=`
- Unary: `++ --`
- Bitwise: `& | ^ ~ << >> >>>`
- Ternary: `?:`

## 8. Difference between == and .equals()
- `==` → Compares **references** (memory addresses).
- `.equals()` → Compares **values/content**.

## 9. When to use for loop / while loop
- **for** → When the number of iterations is known.
- **while** → When the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

## 10. Difference between while and do-while loop
- **while** → Checks condition first, may run 0 times.
- **do-while** → Executes at least once, then checks condition.

## 11. What is infinite loop?
A loop that never ends because the condition is always true.
```java
while(true) { }
```

## 12. What is method? Syntax for creating method.
Method = Block of code that performs a task.
```java
returnType methodName(parameters) {
   // code
   return value;
}
```

## 13. What is passing value?
When calling a method, the variable’s **value** is sent to the method’s parameter.

## 14. What is returning value?
When a method sends back a value to the calling code using `return`.

## 15. What is String? List methods of String.
String = Sequence of characters in Java (immutable).
Methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `equals()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`, `concat()`

## 16. What is array? Syntax for creating array.
Array = Collection of similar data types in a single variable.
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
```

## 17. What is the use of break keyword?
- Used to exit loops early.
- Also used in `switch` to terminate a case.

## 18. What is the use of default in switch statement?
Executes when no `case` matches the value.
